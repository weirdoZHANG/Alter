### Datasets

To get started, you will need to download the datasets as described in our paper:

* Pre-processed datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy?usp=sharing), as obtained from [Autoformer's](https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer) GitHub repository.
* Place the downloaded datasets into the `datasets/` folder, e.g. `datasets/ETT-small/ETTm2.csv`.
